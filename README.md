# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

## Semantic Versioning :mage:

This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for its tagging.

[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format: 

 **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, eg. `1.0.1`

   - **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
   - **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
   - **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

## Install the Terraform CLI

## Considerations with the Terraform CLI changes
The Terraform CLI installation instructions have changed due to gpg keyring changes, so we needed to refer to the latest install CLI instructions via Terraform dcoumentation and change the scripting for install.

### Considerations for Linuix Distributions

This project is built against Ubuntu.
Please consider checking your Linux Distribrution and change accordingly to distribution needs.

Example of checking OS Version:

```
$ cat /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"
VERSION="22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
UBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy
```

### Refactoring into Bash Scripts

While fixing the Terraform CLI gpd deprecation issues we noticed the batch scripts steps were a considerable amount more code. SO we decided to create a bash script to install the Terraform CLI. 

This bash script is located here: [./bin/install_terraform_cli](./bin/install_terraform_cli)

- This will keep the Gitpod Task File ([.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml)) tidy.
- This allows us an easier wato to debug and execute manually Terraform CLI install.
- This will allow better protability for other projects that need to install Terraform CLI.

#### Shebang Considerations

A Shebang (pronouced Sha-ban) tells the bash script what program will interpret the script. eg. '#!/bin/bash'

ChatGPT recommended this format for bash: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

- for portability for different OS distributions
- will search the user's PATH for the bash executable

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

#### Execution Considerations

When executing the bash script we can user the './' shorthand notation to execute the bash script.

eg. `./bin/install_terraform_cli`

If we are using a script in .gitpod.yml we need to point the script to a program to interpert it.

eg. `source ./bin/install_terraform_cli`

#### Linux Permissions Considerations

In order to make our bash scripts executable we need to change Linux permissions for the fix to be executable at the user mode.

```sh
chmod u+x ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

Alternatively:

```sh 
chmod 744 ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

### Github Lifecycle (Before, Init, Command)

We need to be careful when using Init because it will not rerun if we restart an existing workspace.

https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks

### Working with Env Vars

We can list out all the Environment Variables (Env Vars) using the `env` command

We can fileter specific env vars using grep eg. `env | grep AWS_`

#### Setting and Unsetting Env Vars

In the terminal we can set using `export HELLO='world'`

In the terminal we unset using `unset HELLO`

We can set an env var temporarily when just running a command

```sh
HELLO-'world' ./bin/print_message
```
Within a bash script we can set an env var without writing export eg.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

HELLO='world'

echo $HELLO
```

#### Printing Vars

We can pring an env var using echo eg. `echo $HELLO`

#### Scoping of Env Vars

When you open up new bash terminals in VSCode it will not be aware of env vars that you have set in another window.

If you want Env Vars to persist across all future bash terminals that are open you need to set the env vars in your bash profile. eg. `.bash_profile`

#### Persisting Env Vars in Gitpod

We can persist env vars into Gitpod by storing them in Gitpod Secrest Storage.

```
gp env HELLO='world'
```

All future workspaces launched will set the env vars for all bash terminals opened in those workspaces.

You can also set en vars in the `.gitpod.yml` but this can only contain non-sensitive env vars.


### AWS CLI Installation


AWS CLI is installed for the project via the bash script [`/bin/install_aws_cli`](/bin/install_aws_cli`)

[Getting Started Install (AWS CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
[AWS CLI Env Vars](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

We can check if our AWS credentials are configured correctly by running the following AWS command:

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

If it is successful you should see a json payload return that looks like this:

```json
{
    "UserId": "AIEAVEPRGMDIHKLZ7BG9E",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam "123456789012:user/terraform-beginner-bootcamp"
}
```

We'll need to generate AWS CLI credentials from IAM User in order to use the AWS CLI.

## Terraform Basics

### Terraform Registry

Terraform sources their providers and modules from the Terraform registry with is located at [registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io)

- **Providers** are an interface to APIs that will allow you to create resources in Terraform.
- **Modules** are a way to make large amounts of terraform code modular, portable, and shareable. 

[Random Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs)
## Terraform Console

We can see a list of all the Terraform commands by simply typing `terraform`

#### Terraform Init

At the start of a new terraform project we will run `terraform init` to download the binaries for the terraform providers that we'll use in this project.

#### Terraform Plan

`terraform plan`

This will generate out a changeset about the state of our intrastructure and what will be changed.

We can ouput this changeset ie. "plan" to be passed to an apply, but often you can just ignore outputting.

#### Terraform Apply

`terraform apply`

This will run a plan and pass the changeset to be executed by Terraform.  Apply should prompt yes or no.

If we want to automatically approve and apply we can proved the auto approve flag eg. `terraform apply --auto-approve`

#### Terraform Destroy

`terraform destroy`

This will destroy resources.

You can also use the auto approve flag to skip the approve prompt eg. `terraform apply --auto-approve`


#### Terraform Lock Files

`.terraform.lock.hcl` coontains the locked versioning for th providers or modules that should be used with this project.

The Terraform Lock FIle **should be committed** to your Version Control System (VSC) eg. Github.

#### Terraform State Files

`.terraform.tfstate` contains information about the current state of your infrastructure.  

This file **should not be commited** to your VCS.  

This file can contain sensitive data.

If you lose this file, you lose knowing the state of your infrastructure.

`.terraform.tfstate.backup` is the previous state file.

#### Terraform Directory

`.terrafrom` directroy contains binaries of terraform providers.


## Issues with Terraform Cloud Login and Gitpod Workspace

When attempting to run `terraform login` it will launch bash in a wisiwig view to generat a token.  However it does not work as expected in Gitpod VSCode in the browser.

The workaround is to manually generate a token in Terraform Cloud

```
https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens?source=terraform-login
```

Then manually create the file here:
```sh
touch /home/gitpod/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
open /home/gitpod/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
```
Provie the following code (replace your token in the file):

```json
{
    "credentials": {
      "app.terraform.io": {
        "token": "YOUR-TERRAFORM-CLOUD-TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
